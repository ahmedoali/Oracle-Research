# Oracle-simulation

A repository to contain work on oracle systems and feed provider interactions research. A fully decentralised oracle will not be able to know the true value but it will need to assess the accuracy of the values given to it at each time point by providers. 

Work in here will include simulation code of an oracle interacting with feed providers and changes in feed providers deposits. It will also include research on how feed inputs deviate from the median for a variety of coins ranging from low market cap to high.
